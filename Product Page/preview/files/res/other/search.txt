Thompson  is given credit for discovering electrons  using a Crookes tube and testing many different gases. Cathode rays were found to be beams of electrons. Chadwick is given credit for the discovery of the neutron.  3 • The Periodic Table & Makeup of Atoms  Terms  I-- Atomic Structure  (2 of 12)   atoms the smallest particle of an element .  It consists of a central nucleus and electron clouds outside the nucleus.  nucleus the dense central portion of an atom.  subatomic smaller than an atom.  The proton, neutron, and electron are subatomic.  net charge the difference in the positive charge due to protons and the negative charge due to electrons in an atom.  nucleons the particles that make up the nucleus.  3 • The Periodic Table & Makeup of Atoms  Terms II-- Atomic Structure  (3 of 12)   atomic number the number of protons in an atom.  This # determines the identity of an element.  mass number the number of protons + neutrons  isotopes atoms with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons.  Atoms with the same atomic number, but different mass numbers.  isotopic notation   shorthand notation for a nucleus that  shows the mass #, atomic # and the symbol.  U-238 would be 238   92U  3 • The Periodic Table & Makeup of Atoms  Calculating Atomic Mass  (4 of 12)   Any real sample of an element contains more than one  naturally occuring isotope . For instance, boron  isotope                   abundance          mass #            isotopic mass  boron-10 10   5B 19.78% 10 mass = 10.013 u  boron-11 11   5B 80.22% 11 mass = 11.009 u  The atomic mass is the weighted average of the isotopes. at. mass = (19.78%)(10.013u) + (80.22%)(11.0009u)  100  or  at. mass = (0.1978)(10.013u) + (0.8022)(11.0009u)  = 10.81 u     3 • The Periodic Table & Makeup of Atoms  Determining Numbers of Protons, Neutrons,  and Electrons from the Isotopic Notation  (5 of 12)   Consider the following symbol:  33 16S2–   The 16 is the atomic number which is the number of  protons.  The 33 is the mass number  which is the mass of one of the  isotopes.  This mass is due to the protons and neutrons .  The number of neutrons is the mass number - the atomic  number.  33 - 16 = 17 neutrons.  Since the charge is 2-, there are 2 more electrons than  protons.  In this case, there are 18 electrons.   3 • The Periodic Table & Makeup of Atoms  Important People in the Development of the  Atomic Theory  (6 of 12)   Democritus   [atomos]  philosopher who argued that matter was discontinuous  John Dalton  [billiard-ball model]  experimented with gases… different substances are different combinations of atoms  J.J. Thomson   [plum-pudding model]  experimented with gas-discharge tubes… atoms have + and – parts… the negative e–’s are the same for any atom  Ernest Rutherford  [nuclear model/solar system model]  most of the mass of the atom is concentrated in a tiny, positively-charged nucleus  Niels Bohr  [quantized electron energy levels]  the electrons have only certain allowed energy levels   3 • The Periodic Table & Makeup of Atoms  Metals, Nonmetals, and Metalloids  (7 of 12)   The elements can be classified as metals, nonmetals, and  metalloids.  Memorize the elements classified as metalloids  (also called semi-metals or semiconductors). Properties of metals include: ductility  - the ability to pull a substance into a wire  sectility - the ability to cut with a knife  malleability - the ability to pound substance into a sheet  conductivity - the ability to carry an electrical current  Gold is the most malleable of all the metals.   3 • The Periodic Table & Makeup of Atoms  Rutherford’s Gold Foil Experiment  (8 of 12)   Ernest Rutherford’s classic gold foil experiment  led to the  nuclear model  of the atom.   a  a  most alpha's  came straight  through here  a few bounced back  at a large angle   gold foil   •  the nucleus is tiny  - because most of the alpha’s missed  the nucleus and went straight through the foil •  the nucleus is positively charged  - because the (+)  charged alpha was repelled by the (+) charged nucleus •  the nucleus is incredibly dense  - because the nucleus was  able to bounce back at a very large angle     3 • The Periodic Table & Makeup of Atoms  The First Periodic Table  (9 of 12)   Meyer and Mendeleev  are given credit for developing the  first version of the periodic table.  Mendelleev’s true claim to fame was that he actually predicted the existence of several element that had not been discovered.  He found gaps in the table when he tried to organize the atoms and left spaces for those elements (ekasilicon = "like silicon", etc.) He predicted Ga, Ge, and Sc. He also arranged elements in order of atomic number rather than the previous idea of atomic mass.  Several of the elements change order... (like Te and I).   3 • The Periodic Table & Makeup of Atoms  Families of the Periodic Table  (10 of 12)   Horizontal rows of the table are called periods.  Vertical columns are called groups or families.  Memorize the names of some groups: IA - the alkali metals IIA - the alkaline earth metals VIIA - the halogens 0 - the noble gases Also know the transition metals, the inner transition metals (composed of the lanthanide series and the actinide series... the lanthanides are also called the rare earth metals)   Families IA - VIIIA are called the representative elements.   3 • The Periodic Table & Makeup of Atoms  Radioactivity Basics  (11 of 12)   Radioactivity was discovered by Henri Becquerel  (but  named by Marie Curie ).  “Becquerel rays” were found to consist of 3 types or radiation: alpha particles (a) a helium nucleus - 2 protons + 2 neutrons  …easily stopped by paper or skin beta particles (b ) a high energy electron  …stopped by Al foil (several thicknesses of foil) gamma radiation (g ) a very high energy form of light (EMR)  …the most penetrating and dangerous of the rays.   3 • The Periodic Table & Makeup of Atoms  JJ Thomson & cathode ray tubes  (12 of 12)   Know the design of a cathode rays tubes.   Realize that  cathode rays are really beams of electrons.  The cathode rays are the same for any substance, but the canal rays  (the  positive ions left after ionizing the gases) are different for each gas. Know how the bending of cathode rays can tell you the charge-to-mass ratio (e/m)  (but not the mass or the charge  of the electron). Millikan’s oil drop experiment  gave evidence for the  charge of the electron.  Knowing this and the e/m ratio, you can calculate the mass of the electron.
